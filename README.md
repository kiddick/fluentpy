Bunch of links extracted from Fluent Python
-------------------------------------------

You can actually find list of links [here](fluentpy.md).

Code is really ugly for now :(

And works only under python 2 due to links was extracted and pickled with py2 version of [PDFMinder tool](https://github.com/euske/pdfminer).

####TODO

* change bare links with headers of pages (resolve shorten links)
* may be use some async approach for that
